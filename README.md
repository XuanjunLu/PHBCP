## Abstract
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histopathological slides contain abundantinformation about cellular and tissue morphology and have been the cornerstone oftumor diagnosis for decades. In recent years, advancements in digital pathologyhave made whole-slide images (WSIs) widely applicable for diagnosis, prognosis,and prediction in brain cancer. However, there remains a lack of systematic toolsand standardized protocols for using handcrafted features in brain cancer histo-logical analysis. In this study, we present a protocol for handcrafted feature analysisin brain cancer pathology (PHBCP) to systematically extract, analyze, model, andvisualize handcrafted features from WSIs. The protocol enabled the discovery ofbiomarkers from WSIs through a series of well-defined steps. The PHBCP com-prises seven main steps: (1) problem definition, (2) data quality control, (3) imagepreprocessing, (4) feature extraction, (5) feature filtering, (6) modeling, and (7)performance analysis. As an exemplary application, we collected pathological dataof 589 patients from two cohorts and applied the PHBCP to predict the 2-yearsurvival of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. Among the 72 modelscombining nine feature selection methods and eight machine learning classifiers,the optimal model combination achieved discriminative performance with anaverage area under the curve (AUC) of 0.615 over 100 iterations under five-foldcross-validation. In the external validation cohort, the optimal model combina-tion achieved a generalization performance with an AUC of 0.594.
